									<a name="outcome"><h2>PROGRAMME OUTCOME/QUALIFICATION</h2></a>
									<p>We run our programme under the composite system. Even though there are three programmes, each with a head, they all run a joint programme leading to the award of a certificate in Entrepreneurial Leadership and Management (with a TVET course).
										In addition we run the National TVET/COTVET/NVTI Programmes.
										<br>When someone goes through the NLETC programme the qualification he/she comes out with is the subject of this document. After reading this document the following are the facts/ information the reader will get: 
										<ul>
											<li>Programmes and course participants will study;</li>
											<li>Certificates that are awarded to participants;</li>
											<li>The level of study and certificates to be awarded; and </li>
											<li>The duration of our programme and courses.</li>
										</ul>
										The focus of NLETC is Entrepreneurship. We seek to train our students/participants to become entrepreneurs- people who create their own businesses and create jobs. So, we give them entrepreneurial skills to achieve that goal. But we believe that entrepreneurship is a spirit which must be brought into reality or made physical through an activity. In other words, if somebody is an entrepreneur, he/she is an entrepreneur in something- vocation or trade. For this reason, we have chosen courses under the Skill Training programme. These are some the courses that have been developed by the Commission for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (COTVET) – which they call /Competency Based Training programmes (CBT). Therefore, as a student of NLETC you are expected to study and major in at least one of these skills.
										<br>We also believe that as an entrepreneur one must have general knowledge about the environment, in which he/she operates in and beyond. For this reason, the participants will study General Education courses.

									</p>

									<h4>REQUIREMENT FOR GRADUATION</h4>	
									<p>As part of the requirements for graduation, our students are expected to register and own a start-up, and employ at least two people,</p>	
									<h4>DURATION</h4>
									<p>Our courses/programmes are in three categories on the basis of their duration, namely: short term, medium term and long term.</p>
									<p><strong>Short term Courses: </strong>They are one to five days subject(s) training workshops and seminars.</p>
									<p><strong>Medium term Courses: </strong>These are one to six months courses/programmes</p>
									<p><strong>Long term Courses: </strong>They are one, two or three years programmes, depending on the background or standard of the student</p>

									<p>The COTVET CBT learning programmes are industry and demand driven based on consultation with all TVET major stakeholders to provide learners with practical skills and experience of the world of work, through the workplace experience learning units, Generic Skills, as well as skills, knowledge and understanding gained through more formal practical training and learning in the institution and workplace.<br><br>                                                                                        
										The proposed National TVET Qualification Framework came jointly from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Master Plan for strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in Ghana and a group of Ghanaian consultants, which was passed by parliament for implementation.<br> The following objectives guided the proposal for the creation of a National TVET Qualification Framework:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>To bring all the post-basic occupation-oriented qualifications into unified qualification framework</li>
										<li>To promote and facilitate access to life-long learning for all, especially operators in the informal sector of the economy</li>
										<li>To facilitate access to further education and training for the individuals in technical and vocational occupations</li>
										<li>To improve product and service quality by ensuring uniform standards of practice in the trades and professions</li>
									</ul>
									<p>These new qualifications are designed to be certificated at eight levels: National Proficiency I, National Proficiency II, National Certificate I, National Certificate II, Higher National Diploma (HND), Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) Master of Technology (M. Tech) and Doctor of Technology (D. Tech).</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<p><a href="proficiencyI"><strong> NATIONAL PROFICIENCY 1:</strong> </a>The National Proficiency I Programme is a bridging programme, allowing   progression for people with minimal or no education background into the National Proficiency II Programme. <br>
										The National Proficiency I Programme focuses on the basic skills, knowledge and understanding within the Technical /Vocational area.<br>
										Recruits to industry will be able to perform routine and predictable tasks often performed under close supervision. Entry into these programmes will normally require no formal Certificate.<br>
										The Programme will also help the learner to prepare and facilitate his/her progression into the general education band through introduction to Generic Skills Units.<br><br>
										<a href="proficiencyII"><strong>NATIONAL PROFICIENCY II:</strong></a>The National Proficiency II Programme allows progression to the National Certificate I Programmes and will provide a window of opportunity to technical institutions entrance for appropriate technical/vocational areas.<br>
										Entry into the National Proficiency II Programme will be through an achievement of COTVET qualification at National Proficiency I level.<br>                   
										Recruits to industry will be able to perform a range of varied work activities most of which may be routine, predictable, and non-complex in nature. The individual will work under limited supervision It will also facilitate progression to National Certificate I and introduction to general education through Generic Skills Units.<br><br>
										<a href="certificateI"><strong>NATIONAL CERTIFICATE I:</strong></a>The National Certificate I Programme allows progression to the National Certificate II Programmes and will provide a window of opportunity to technical institution entrance for the appropriate technical/vocational areas.<br><br>
										Entry into the National Certificate I Programme will be through National Proficiency II Level or a pass at BECE in the appropriate subjects and or an equivalent.<br><br>
										Recruits to industry will be able to perform complex and varied activities under minimum supervision and also develop employable skills through significant workplace experience learning, thus enhancing their employment prospects.<br><br>
										<a href="certificateII"><strong>NATIONAL CERTIFICATE II:</strong></a>The National Certificate II Programme allows progression to the HND or B. Tech programmes and will provide a window of opportunity to technical /vocational institution entrance for appropriate technical/vocational areas.<br>
										Entry into the National Certificate II Programme will be through a National Certificate I level, or a pass at WASSCE in the appropriate subjects and points total or an equivalent.<br>
										Recruits to industry will be able to perform wide variety of work, most of which are complex and non-routine. There is considerable responsibility and autonomy in the performance of work, and ability to control or give guidance to others is often required.<br><br>
										<a href="HND"><strong>HIGHER NATIONAL DIPLOMA (HND):</strong></a>The HND Programme allows progression to the Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) or Master of Technology (M. Tech) programmes and will provide a window of opportunity to technical /vocational institution entrance for the appropriate technical/vocational areas.<br>
										Entry into the HND programmes will be through a National Certificate II Level, or a pass at WASSCE in appropriate subjects and points total or an equivalent.<br>
										Recruits to industry will be able to perform wide variety of work, most of which are complex and non-routine. Work activities comprise tasks involving some level of organizational ability, resource management, and accountability for performing own processes and outputs as well as accountability for the processes and outputs of others.<br><br>
										<a href="BTECH"><strong>BACHELOR OF TECHNOLOGY (B. TECH): </strong></a>The B. Tech Programme allows progression to the Master of Technology programme and will provide a window of opportunity to technical /vocational institution entrance for the   appropriate technical/vocational areas.<br>
										Entry into the B. Tech Programme will be through a COTVET National Certificate II or HND Level, or equivalent qualification in the appropriate subjects and points.<br>
										Recruits to industry will be able to perform wide variety of work, most of which are complex and non-routine. Activities are mainly self-directed, requiring a significant degree of strategic thinking and judgement. A high level of organizational and resource management skills are required and the individual assumes full accountability for own processes and outputs as well as the processes and outputs of others within broadly defined boundaries.<br><br>
										<a href="MTECH"><strong>MASTER OF TECHNOLOGY (M. TECH):</strong></a>The M. Tech Programme allows progression to the Doctor of Technology programmes and will provide a window of opportunity to technical /vocational institution entrance for appropriate technical /vocational areas.<br>

Recruits to industry will be able to perform wide variety of work, most of which involve the resolution of complex issues and making sound judgment in the absence of complex data, and communicating these conclusions to both specialist and non-specialist audiences. They also continue to advance their knowledge and understanding and to develop new skills to a high level.<br>
										The M. Tech Programme requires self-direction and originality in tackling and solving problems, and acting independently in planning and implementing tasks at a professional level. It promotes quality and transferable skills necessary for employment, initiative and personal responsibility and decision-making in complex and unpredicted situations, and the exhibition of independent learning ability required for continuing professional development.<br><br>

Recruits will be able to exhibit qualities and transferable skills necessary in exercising of personal responsibility and initiative in a very complex and unpredictable situation.<br><br>
										
										<a name="awards"><h4>Certificates / Awards </h4></a>When one studies in NLETC he/she is awarded multiple certificates. The first is the certificate that is awarded but NLETC, know as Entrepreneurial Leadership and Management, (Levels I, II III and IV). This is based on our students’ successfully going through our three programmes namely: Entrepreneurship, Skills Development and General Education.
										The second certificate that a student will get is by passing the programmes developed by COTVET which NLECT run as accredited programmes. The certificates / qualifications and the levels are as follows:<br>
										<img class="" src="">
										As explained earlier the NLETC programme focuses on entrepreneurship education and training. We combine this with Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET), which we refer to as Skills Development. Since there is a National Commission on TVET that has developed programmes for training, NLECT has secured accreditation to run some of those CBT programmes. Therefore, our students write the COTVET based examinations and get their certificates. The levels of the national TVET qualification are eight (8). The lowest, the National Proficiency I and II (NPI and NPII) forms the basic certificates. The two put together is the equivalent of the BECE examination of the Junior High School (JHS). 
										<br>The national certificate I (NCI) and II (NCII) constitute the intermediate certificates. It is the equivalent of the WASSCE of the Senior High School (SHS)
										<br>From the intermediate one moves to the Higher National Diploma (HND) level. That is the advance certificate under the National TVET Qualification levels. It is the bridge between the pre-tertiary and the tertiary system of education in the TVET sector.
										<br><br>The HND/advance certificate qualifies one to move further to the tertiary levels of study, where he/she can study for the Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech); Master of Technology (M. Tech) and finally Doctor of Technology (D. Tech) respectively. 
										<br><br>One can use a period of between ten and fifteen years to make it from the proficiency level to the Doctor of Technology level. We have planned for our students to cover the various levels using a maximum of three years for the basic and intermediary and a maximum of three years for the advance and tertiary certificates. 
										<br><br>Therefore, if a JHS student, for example starts the programme at age twelve (12) it is expected that by age twenty-seven (27) or maximum thirty (30) the person would have obtained the Doctor of Technology (D. Tech).
										<br>Adults who are more determined should be able to attain the Higher National Diploma (HND) in a maximum of six years (6) or less, starting from the basic.
										<br>In sum, this is the path that enables one to use the National TVET Qualification levels to become a Doctor of Technology (D. Tech) equivalent to Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in academic education. So, one can see clearly that another way has been created for people who want to use the TVET path to also reach the destination of a PhD. Indeed, there is another way.
