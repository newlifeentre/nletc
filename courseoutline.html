                                         <h4>Course Overview</h4><p>Even though money is needed in all human endeavors, not much is known about money. We go to school to study everything from Archaeology to Zoology but nobody cares much about the study of money, even though the motive of all our education boils down to one thing- the search for money.<br>
                                            Neither the school, family nor the church teaches us about money. There is no doubt knowledge about money or financial literacy and education is shrouded in secrecy. In the end we attain all the degrees in this world but are not literate in the one thing that is fundamental to all that we do. The result is that we get into all sorts of complex challenges when it comes to issues with money. It is only the few who are able to go beyond this mystery who overcome this global money problem. It is a matter about which very little is known or understood. The course seeks to address the problem lack of knowledge about money in most societies.</p>

                                             <h4>Course Overview</h4><p>How easily do we throw our hands in despair when faced with difficult situations? Every situation must be controlled to a fruitful end to achieve the desire goal or mitigate outcomes. Management has often been seen as a situational science. We are often confronted with situations, good or bad and we have to come out with decisions in order obtain a desired result.<br> To be able to manage successfully, one has to know, understand and must have experienced the situation. And there must be the presence of resources to be able to take care of the situation. What about if one does not have the knowledge, competences, skills, experience and the resources to take care of the situation? This is where the problem arises- mismanagement of the situation and the usual adverse consequences. To manage better therefore, one has to be conversant with as many connected fields of study as possible, of what is to be managed. On this basis management could also be viewed as an integration of various business, social sciences and science courses. Management thus, cuts across many disciplines of study.</p>

                                                 <h4>Course Overview</h4><p>The second most important factor in entrepreneurship and for that matter, any business apart from the human resource is finance, money or the bottom line. To be an entrepreneur and not be conversant with the recording and tracking of the money that comes in and goes out of one’s business is to not know what he/she is in business for. It will be like a farmer who has left the gates of their animal farm ajar. An entrepreneur who does not know how to keep the gates of his income and expenditure will be at the mercy of financial predators.<br> An entrepreneur does not necessarily need to hold a degree(s) in Book-keeping or Accounting but she must be conversant with matters affecting the bottom line. This course therefore seeks to introduce students to basic book-keeping and accounting to help them track and manage their finances better.</p>

Leadership and authority is very important in all human endeavors including entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur brings together human and material resources to produce goods and services. The entrepreneur must have leadership skills to be able to succeed. The question is, do people always get the right leaders to lead them? Leadership is said to be a cause and everything else, a result – (John C. Maxwell). <br>Leadership is supposed to lead followers to their desired destination. They are expected to take responsibilities for the needs of their followers, haven been entrusted with the resources of a nation or an institution. Leadership must therefore be well prepared, experienced and competent to be able to offer the leadership that benefits all. The purpose of leadership is first and foremost to serve followers. Leaders must show that they are with and for the people. Unfortunately, in most cases leadership is used for a different purpose. It appears leaders now come to profit from leadership instead of serving. Followers must now serve their leaders. There is a leadership crisis in most situations that must be addressed for peace and development to prevail.  This course introduces students to the theory and practice of leadership and the crucial role it plays in human endeavors. </p>
